# Configuration

Orchard Core extends ASP.NET Core `IConfiguration` with `IShellConfiguration` to allow tenant-specific configuration on top of the application-wide one.

To learn more about ASP.NET Core `IConfiguration` visit <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration>.

Note that while this documentation page explains configuration happening in the root web app project on the example of `OrchardCore.Cms.Web.csproj` if you use Orchard from NuGet packages in your own web app then same is available in that web app project too.


## Config Sources

Orchard Core supports a hierarchy of Configuration Sources

* The `Startup` ASP.NET Core Project, e.g. `OrchardCore.Cms.Web.csproj`, `appsettings.json`, or by environment  `appsettings.Development.json`.
* Global Tenant Configuration `App_Data/appsettings.json`, or by environment `App_Data/appsettings.Development.json`.
* Individual Tenant Configuration files located under each Tenant Folder in the `App_Data/Sites/{tenant_name}/appsettings.json` folder. **Note:** These are mutable files, and do not support an Environment version.
* Environment Variables, or AppSettings as Environment Variables via Azure.

The Configuration Sources are loaded in the above order, and settings lower in the hierarchy will override values configured higher up, i.e. an Global Tenant value will always be overridden by an Environment Variable.

### `IShellConfiguration` in the `OrchardCore.Cms.Web.csproj` Startup Project

Orchard Core stores all Configuration data under the `OrchardCore` section in `appsettings.json` files:

```
{
  "OrchardCore": {
      ... module configurations ...
  }
}
```

Each Orchard Core module has its own configuration section under the `OrchardCore` section:

```
{
  "OrchardCore": {
    "OrchardCore.Media": {
      ... individual module configuration ...
    }
  }
}
```

See the `appsettings.json` file for more examples.

In addition you can specify a `Tenant` setting by using the Tenant Name, in this example the `Default` tenant. The tenant must exist and you need to include a `State` key for it to be recognized by `IShellConfiguration`. The value of the key is not important as the value in the `tenants.json` file will be used. The tenant name is case sensitive.

```
{
  "OrchardCore": {
    "Default": {
      "State": "Placeholder",
      "OrchardCore_Media": {
        ... specific tenant configuration configuration ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also configure `IOptions` from code in the web project's `Startup` class as explained in the [ASP.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options). 

A lot of Orchard Core features are configured through the admin UI with site settings stored in the database. If you wish to override the site settings, you can do this with your own configuration code.

For example, the Email module allows SMTP configuration via the `SmtpSettings` class which by default is populated from the given tenant's site settings, as set on the admin. However, you can override the site settings from the `Startup` class like this (note that we use `PostConfigure` to override the site settings' values but if the module doesn't use site settings you can just use `Configure`):

```
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddOrchardCms()
        .ConfigureServices(configure =>
            configure.PostConfigure<SmtpSettings>(settings =>
            {
                // You could e.g. fetch the configuration values from an injected IShellConfiguration instance here.
                settings.Port = 255;
            }));
}
```

This will thus make the SMTP port use this configuration despite any other value defined from site settings. 

!!! note 
    On the admin there will be no indication that this override happened, and the value displayed there will still be 
    the one configured in site settings, so if you choose to do this you'll need to let your users know.

### `ORCHARD_APP_DATA` Environment Variable

The location of the `App_Data` folder can be configured by setting the `ORCHARD_APP_DATA` environment variable. Paths can be relative to the application path (./App_Data), absolute (/path/from/root), or fully qualified (D:\Path\To\App_Data). If the folder does not exist the application will attempt to create it.

### `IShellConfiguration` in the Global Tenant Configuration `App_Data/appsettings.json`

These settings can also be located in an `App_Data/appsettings.json` folder (not created by default), and any settings specified there will override settings from the `Startup` Project.

### `IShellConfiguration` in the Individual Tenants Folder

These settings are mutable and written during the setup for the Tenant. For this reason reading from Environment Name is not supported.
Additionally these `appsettings.json` files do not need the `OrchardCore` section

```
{
  "OrchardCore_Media": {
    ... specific tenant configuration configuration ...
  }
}
```

### `IShellConfiguration` via Environment Variables

Environment variables are also translated into `IShellConfiguration`, for example

```
OrchardCore__OrchardCore.Media__MaxFileSize

OrchardCore__Default__State
OrchardCore__Default__OrchardCore_Media__MaxFileSize
```

### Order of hierarchy

By default an Orchard Core site will use `CreateDefaultBuilder` in the Startup Project's `Program.cs` which will load `IConfiguration` in the following order

1. Startup project `appsettings.json`
2. Startup project `appsettings.{environment}.json`
3. User Secrets (if environment is __Development__)
4. Environment Variables
5. Command Line Args
6. `IShellConfiguration` will then add these
    1. `App_Data/appsettings.json`
    2. `App_Data/Sites/{tenant_name}/appsettings.json` for the particular tenant

!!! note
    Configurations with the same key that are loaded later take precedence over those which were loaded earlier (last wins).

### Configuration during Deployment

Azure App Settings are supported as Environment Variables on a Windows Environment, and Linux support is coming.

Azure DevOps, or other CI/CD pipelines, are supported, on all platforms, and Json Path Transformations can be used to transform `appsettings.json` files and provide app secrets from pipeline variables, or secret key stores like Azure Key Vault.

If building with the nightly dev builds from the `MyGet` package feed, the CI/CD pipeline will need to use a `NuGet.Config` with the location of the `MyGet` package feed.

```
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json"/>
    <add key="myget" value="https://www.myget.org/F/orchardcore-preview/api/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
